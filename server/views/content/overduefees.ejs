    <h1>Overdue Fees</h1>

    <h2>Library Overdue Policies</h2>
    <p>
        The library operates on the following overdue policy to ensure fair usage of resources:
    </p>

    <h3>Overdue Periods and Fines</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>First day: No fine (grace period)</li>
        <li>Third day: $1.50 per day</li>
        <li>Third Week: $2.00 per day</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overdue Fine Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The overdue fine structure is designed to encourage the prompt return of borrowed materials.
        Fines are calculated based on the duration an item is overdue and accrue daily until the item is returned.
    </p>

    <h3>Duration-based Fines</h3>
    <p>
        - For items overdue by:<br>
        &emsp;- <strong>1 day:</strong> No fine<br>
        &emsp;- <strong>3 days:</strong> $01.50 per day<br>
        &emsp;- <strong>1 week:</strong> $1.00 per day<br>
        &emsp;- <strong>3 week:</strong> $2.00 per day<br>
        &emsp;- <strong>1 month:</strong> $3.00 per day<br>
        &emsp;- <strong>More than 1 month:</strong> Library membership suspension and additional fees may apply.
    </p>

    <h3>Actions for Overdue Items</h3>
    <p>
        If an item remains overdue for an extended period, actions may include:<br>
        - <strong>Loss of borrowing privileges:</strong> Suspended membership until all fines are paid.<br>
        - <strong>Account holds:</strong> Preventing access to library resources or services until fines are resolved.<br>
        - <strong>Collection agency involvement:</strong> For extreme cases of overdue materials or unpaid fines.<br>
        - <strong>Replacement fees:</strong> Charged for unreturned or lost items.
